    This base class serves as a basic Discontinuous Galerkin solver for 1D hyperbolic PDEs and is
    written to be as clear as possible to those who are new to such solvers. To add support for a
    particular PDE (e.g., advection, SWE, etc.), the three abstract methods
    :func:`dg.hyperbolic_solver_1d.Hyperbolic1DSolver.hyperbolic_flux_term`,
    :func:`dg.hyperbolic_solver_1d.Hyperbolic1DSolver.hyperbolic_flux_jacobian`, and
    :func:`dg.hyperbolic_solver_1d.Hyperbolic1DSolver.source_term` defined in this class must be
    implemented. See :class:`dg.swe_1d.ShallowWater1D` for an example.

    This class also contains a basic function for animating numerical solutions; by default, all
    solution variables are plotted as subplots in a single animation, though this behavior can be
    overridden as desired by the subclasses implementation. See :class:`dg.swe_1d.ShallowWater1D`
    for an example.
